Feednix
=======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anders-dc/Feednix.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/anders-dc/Feednix)

An ncurses based client for [Feedly](http://feedly.com/).

## Install

### Distribution Packages

[Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/feednix/)

### From Source

First run autogen.sh script.

Then run your standard make commands. Here is a one liner:

`./configure && make && sudo make install`

Thank you @chrisjohnston for mentioning the following dependencies for Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libjsoncpp-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libncurses5-dev`

For macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), install the prerequisites with:

`brew install jsoncpp`

Install to `/usr/local/bin` with the following:

`./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && make install`

## Clarification on Sign In Method (PLEASE READ)

Due to the fact that this is open source, the administrators at Feedly have
asked me to use their developer tokens instead of giving me a client secret.
To explain, if I were to use a client secret I would need to distribute it
along with the source code. This is an obvious security risk and I am going
to keep this project open source, hence this new method.

**Unfortunatley, as of now, the Developer tokens have an expiration of**
**three months. This means that you must create a new one every three months.**

**I have modified Feednix to help you with this. IT CANNOT DO THIS**
**AUTOMATICALLY since developer tokens involve sending you an email**
**to retrieve them.**

## Usage

### Global Options

* q : Exit
* Vim Key mappings for navigation (j,k)

### Post List Options

* Enter : open post preview
* o (lower case) : Open post link in console (currently using w3m)
* O (upwer case) : Open post link in Browser (user default)
* r : Mark post read
* u : Mark post unread
* A : mark all posts read
* R : Refresh category
* = : Change sort type

### Category List Options

* Enter : Fetch Stream (Retrive post by category)
* A : Mark category read
* R : Refersh highlighted category (Retrive post by category)

## Setting

Feednix will create a setting file on the first launch at `~/.config/feednix/config.json`.

* `seconds_to_mark_as_read` (integer, default = `0`) : Indicates how many seconds an article should have been shown for when Feednix marks it as read automatically.  A negative value indicates that Feednix won't mark an article as read unless you does so by "r" key.
